.. contents::

This tool has been developped with these initial goals in mind, in this
priority order:

 - **Merging** 2 different OpenERP databases into a single multicompany db
 - **Migrating** from OpenERP 6.1 to 7.0
 - Migrating data from a legacy business application such as Access, Delphi, etc. (not yet implemented)
 - Migrating from Dolibarr to OpenERP (not yet implemented)

The principle of this tool is to export CSV data from an old application (only
OpenERP for now), then to process CSV files in order to import them into a
freshly installed OpenERP database. This is a completely different strategy
than the in-place migration of OpenERP or OpenUpgrade and allows to start over
from a clean database, while keeping history.  Import and export are done with
the PostgreSQL-specific COPY command, and results in extremely fast exports and
imports. Combined with a pure in-memory Python csv processing, this tool can
often achieve overall migration rates over 2000 lines/sec.


Installation
============

This tool only works with **Python 3**!

With virtualenv
---------------
::

    $ virtualenv sandbox
    $ sandbox/bin/pip install anybox.migration.openerp
    $ sandbox/bin/migrate -h

With Buildout
-------------

If you're using Buildout, you may add this tool in a new part like this::

    [migration]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = anybox.migration.openerp

Then, don't forget to add the ``migration`` section in the ``parts`` of the
``[buildout]`` section. After relaunching ``bin/buildout``, the ``migrate``
script will appear in the ``bin`` directory of the buildout.

Starting from the version 1.7 of the `OpenERP buildout recipe
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.recipe.openerp>`_ You may also install
this tool directly in your ``[openerp]`` part, just by adding::

    eggs = anybox.migration.openerp
    scripts = migrate

Usage
=====

This tool offers a single ``migrate`` script::

    $ migrate -h

You can list the available default mapping files::


    $ migrate -l
    openerp6.1-openerp7.0.yml

You should specify the source and target DBs, a selection of the source tables
to migrate, and the mapping files to use.  The tool then takes care of
selecting the dependant tables::

    $ migrate -s source_dbname -t target_dbname -r res_partner account_move -p openerp6.1-openerp7.0.yml custom.yml

If you want to inspect the temporary CSV files created, use the ``--keepcsv``
option. They will be stored in a temporary directory under the current
directory.

This script won't actually write anything in the target database unless you
specify the ``-w`` option to commit the transaction at the end.

The most important part of the migration process is the YML mapping file, which
describes how to handle data, table by table and column by column. A default
mapping file is provided and is being used as a real mapping for a migration
consisting in migrating two 6.1 databases into a single 7.0 multicompany
database.  You can mix the default 6.1 to 7.0 file provided, and augment it
with other custom yml files, they will be merged.


Internals
=========

This tool was very loosely inspired from:

 - the external_referential OpenERP module
 - the OpenUpgrade project
 - Talend Open Studio

The different internal steps are:

 - Exporting CSV from the old database
 - Transforming CSV to match the target database
 - Detect data existing in the target DB with discriminators
 - Postprocessing CSV files to fix foreign keys
 - Reinjecting into OpenERP
 - Updating possible pre-existing data with incoming data

The processing of CSV files is done using a mapping file written in Yaml.
Initial versions of the mapping file have been written with the help of the
OpenUpgrade analysis files.


Mapping file
============

You should keep in mind that this migration tool is only dealing with database
tables and columns: the OpenERP/Odoo Models and Fields are unknown to it.
Each table, each line, each cell of the source database is handled independently
and the mapping file tells what to do with the current cell.
This leads to limitations
and this tool won't be able to handle extremely complex migration.
But it is powerful enough to allow to simultaneously merge and migrate
two 6.1 databases into a 7.0 multicompany database.

For a real-life example, you can have a look at the OpenERP 6.1 to 7.0 mapping
file provided in the ``mappings`` directory of this tool.

Copying data
------------

The most simple and basic YML statement for a column mapping is the following::

    module:
        table1.column1:
            table2.column2: __copy__

It tells that, if the OpenERP ``module`` is installed in the **target**
database, the ``column1`` of the ``table1`` from the source DB should be copied
to the ``column2`` of the ``table2`` in the target DB.

The ``__copy__`` instruction can even be omitted and the previous statement is
equivalent to this one::

    module:
        table1.column1:
            table2.column2:

Internally, this statement is actually converted to a Python dict::

    {'module':
        {'table1.column1':
            {'table2.column2': '__copy__'}}

The whole yml file is converted to a large mapping dict whose leafs are
statements or functions which are able to process data.

Copying all columns of a table
------------------------------

If your target table has the same structure as the source table, you can avoid
specifying one mapping statement for each column and use a wildcard::

    module:
        table1.*:

It means: copy all the columns of table1 from the source db to table1 in the
target db.  This kind of mapping is often used as a starting point when source
and table structures are similar. You can then add mapping statements for
specific columns to override this wildcard.

Copying all columns to a different table
----------------------------------------

If the source table has only been renamed, you can copy all the columns of the
source table1 to the target table2::

    module:
        table1.*:
            table2.*:

Copying everything
------------------

If the source and target db have exactly the same structure and you just want
to transfer data, you may use a global wildcard (but we have not had the
opportunity to try this one for real yet)::

    module:
        .*:

It means: copy all tables to the target database without processing. It may
seem unuseful compared to a bare dump and restore, but remind that this way you
can append data to the target DB, not only replace it. In that case you should
take care of existing data, if the table has constraints (see discriminators
below).

Splitting one source line to several tables (table splitting)
-------------------------------------------------------------

For a single source line coming from a source table, you can feed data in
several target tables. This can be done just by putting several target lines
like this::

    module:
        table1.column1:
            table2.column2:
            table3.column3:

It means: for each ``column1`` in the ``table1`` of the source DB, create two
target lines: one for ``table2`` and one for ``table3``.

During the processing of the current line, other mapping statements
can feed the same target lines. Take this example::

    module:
        table1.column1:
            table2.column2:
            table3.column3:
        table1.column2:
            table2.column2:
            table3.column4:

In this case, data in the ``table1`` will be directed to ``table2`` and
``table3``. You can then add more lines to handle all the columns of ``table1``

However in the example above, there is a conflict since two source cells are directed
to the same target cell (``table2.column2``). In this scenario, there is no way to
predict which one will be used (because the mapping is a Python *dict* and a dict is not
ordered). You should avoid this kind of conflicts.

In case of an OpenERP 6.1 to 7.0 migration, this kind of mapping is actually
used to migrate one source ``res_users`` line to three different lines: one in
``res_users`` + one in ``res_partner`` + one in ``mail_alias``. See the default
mapping for a real example.

Use specific queries to extract source data
-------------------------------------------

By default full tables are extracted from the source database.

If you want to extract only part of the data, or use a specific SQL sentence for the
table data extraction, use the special source column ``__query__``::

    module:
        table1.__query__: <WHERE expression | SQL statement>

Example for using a specific filter: suppose you only want to extract active
Partners for Company 1::

    module:
        table1.__query__: active = 't' and company_id=1


Example for using a full SQL sentence: suppose you need to inject into the
source table a column from another related table. A specific case for this
is the ``product_template`` in version 8.0 now hosting columns previously
stored in the ``product_product`` table::

    product
        product_template.*:
        product_template.__query__: |
            SELECT t.*, p.color
            FROM product_template t
            INNER JOIN product_product p on p.product_templ_id = t.id

Data moved to another table (table merging)
-------------------------------------------

When input lines must move to a different table, you should use the
``__moved__`` statement against its ``id`` column.  It will allow all the
foreign keys pointing to them to be converted so that they point to the new
table after migration. This statement is not able to move a column from a table
to another table.

The only current situation in OpenERP is for the ``res_partner_address`` data
moving to the ``res_partner`` table::

    base:
        res_partner_address.id:
            res_partner.id: __moved__

This statement must be accompanied with a ``__fk__`` statement for all the
foreign keys pointing to the moved table (See the ``__fk__`` chapter).

Not migrating a column
----------------------

If you want to get rid of a specific column in a table, use the ``__forget__``
statement::

    module:
        table1.column1: __forget__

This statement is useful if you defined a wildcard, to prevent from migrating a
specific column.


Transforming data with Python code
----------------------------------

Instead of just copying data with the ``__copy__`` statement, you can use any
Python code. The Python code should be written in a literal Yaml block and is
executed as is, as a function body, so that you have to insert a ``return``
statement somewhere.

Example from the ``mail`` module::

    mail:
        mail_message.type:
            mail_message.type: return 'email'

It means the ``type`` column of the ``mail_message`` table will be filled with
``'email'`` strings, whatever data the source column had.

The eventual signature of the function constructed using the Python code block is ::

    def mapping_function(self, source_row, target_rows):

It means that in the function body you can access the full ``source_row``,
which is a dict containing all the keys (column names) and values of the
current line being processed. But keep in mind that at this time, you are
dealing with one specific cell of this line, and you should return the value
that will be inserted in the corresponding cell of the target table. This can
be used to aggregate data from two source cells into a target cell::

    base:
        table1.firstname: __forget__
        table1.name:
            table1.name: return source_row['firstname'] + ' ' + source_row['name']

You can also access the ``target_rows`` beeing filled during the processing of
the line, so that data coming from a source cell can influence several cells in
the target lines, or even different target tables. Here is an example::

    base:
        table1.id:
            table1.id:
            table2.id:
        table1.name:
            table1.name: |
                name = source_row['firstname'] + ' ' + source_row['name']
                target_rows['table1']['display_name'] = name
                target_rows['table2']['display_name'] = name
                return name
            table2.name

Note that in the example above, the Python code spans on several lines, and you
should define a Yaml literal block using ``|``. The example above eventually
means: append ``firstname`` to ``name`` coming from the ``table1``, and put it
in the ``display_name`` cell of the target ``table1`` and ``table2``. The
target ``name`` cell will contain a copy of the source ``name`` cell.

If the target line is not supposed to have the same *id* as the source line,
you can create a new *id* with the ``newid()`` function. This function returns a
different value at each call and is responsible of incrementing the *id*. Here
is an example::

    base:
        res_users.id:
            res_users.id:
            res_users.partner_id:
            res_partner.notification_email_send: return 'comment'
            res_partner.id: |
                i = newid()
                target_rows['res_users']['partner_id'] = i
                target_rows['res_partner']['id'] = i
                target_rows['res_partner']['name'] = source_row['name']
                target_rows['res_partner']['email'] = source_row['user_email']
                return i

Each ``res_users`` line will generate a new ``res_partner`` line with a new
*id*, while the ``res_users`` *id* will be the same as the source. (Actually it
will not be the same, because an offset is applied to all ids).

[TODO FIXME!]
For very advanced users, the ``self`` variable of the function correspond to
the CSVProcessor instance, because the function is executed from inside this
processor by passing self, so you can access all the internal registries of the
processor. You can find an example in the provided mapping, around the
statements used for the workflow migration. But you have to understand how and
when these registries are used to be able to use this feature. 

Feeding a new column
--------------------

If a target column should contain data but has no equivalent in the source
table, you can use '_' as a substitute to the not existing source column name::

    base:
        res_partner._:
            res_partner.is_company: return False


Merging with existing data
--------------------------

When data is inserted in the target table, you may want to merge it with
existing data.

Imagine the target ``res_users`` table already contains an
``admin`` account, and you don't want to duplicate this account by migrating
data from the source ``res_users`` table. In this case you should tell the
mapping how to recognize existing data. This is done by replacing the
source column name with the ``__discriminator__`` statement, and by providing a
list of column names that will be used to recognize existing data::

    base:
        res_users.__discriminator__:
            - login

Using this statement, you can install a new OpenERP database with its admin
account, and merge all existing accounts with data coming from the source
table. The ``login`` column will be used to match data. The preexisting *admin*
account won't be duplicated but will be updated with the *admin* account from
the source table.

Another use case in a multicompany scenario is to merge partners existing in
the target database, but keep them separate for the two companies::

    base:
        res_partner.__discriminator__:
            - name
            - company_id

Foreign keys without constraints
--------------------------------

The first step of the migration is to automatically detect all the foreign keys
of the source and target tables. Sometimes, OpenERP defines foreign keys
without constraints. This mainly happens with *related* fields with
``store=True``, which create a column of integers without constraints. If you
don't want to ``__forget__`` such columns, you have to tell the mapping what
the target of the foreign key is, like in the real example below::

    account:
        account_move.company_id:
            account_move.company_id: __fk__ res_company


Here is another example for the ``crm_lead`` table, which may contain a field
coming from a ``__moved__`` table. Imagine you want the ``partner_id`` field of
the CRM leads in OpenERP 7.0 to come from the ``partner_address_id`` field of
the same table in OpenERP 6.1.  The new field is a foreign key to
``res_partner``, while the old one was pointing to ``res_partner_address``. You
can tell this with the following statement::

    crm_lead.partner_address_id:
        crm_lead.partner_id: __fk__ res_partner_address

However you should also not forget to forget the partner_id field, or you will
have a conflict an mix data badly if you used a wildcard for the table::

    crm_lead.*:
    crm_lead.partner_id: __forget__

Reference fields
----------------

Sometimes columns define a dynamic reference id to another table, just like a
foreign key, except that the name of the table is actually stored in another
column.

=== ================= =======
id  model              res_id
=== ================= =======
1   cr.claim           23
2   cr.claim           35
3   base.action.rule   27
=== ================= =======

In the example above, since the ``res_id`` is not a real foreign key, its value
won't be fixed to correspond to the target database. In that case you should
use the ``__ref__`` statement, followed by the name of the column holding the
table or model name. This statement assumes the model-to-table transformation
of OpenERP is used (replacing '.' with '_')::


    mail_message.res_id:
        mail_message.res_id: __ref__ model


Handle cyclic dependant tables
------------------------------

TODO: deprecate __defer__; work around this using ALTER TABLE res_users DISABLE|ENABLE TRIGGER ALL

During the last step, the migrated CSV files are imported one by one.  Some
tables depend on other tables through foreign key constraints, and such
dependencies sometimes happen to be cyclic. In that case, there is no way to
import tables because they all depend on another one. One solution is to
``__forget__`` the column, which is rarely desirable because you lose data. To
be able to keep such data, you should use the ``__defer__`` statement, so that
the column will be updated after all the data is imported::

    base:
        res_users.create_uid:
            res_users.create_uid: __defer__
        res_users.write_uid:
            res_users.write_uid: __defer__

running SQL requests during migration
-------------------------------------

In case the wanted migration is too complex to be handled by regular
statements, you can run SQL queries on both the source and target database.
This should be used in limited cases because the queries will be executed for
each source cell for which the mapping defines it, and the migration may be
slowed down, unless you limit the queries with manual caching. (See the
workflow migration in the mapping).

A simple sql() function is available in the mapping file, and has the following signature::

    sql(db, query, args)

    where:
    - db is the string 'source' or 'target'
    - query is the SQL query
    - args is the arguments to insert in the query
    The query is actually executed with: cursor.execute(query, args)

Here is an example::

    base:
        res_users._:
            (...)
            mail_alias.alias_model_id: return sql('target', "select id from ir_model where model='res.users'")[0][0]

Field size limit
----------------

When running migration, you may encounter a ``csv.Error: field larger than
field limit``. This is due to the csv module limiting the csv field size to
128k by default. The default value has been increased to 20MB. If this is not
enough for your migration, you can increase the limit by inserting a direct
call to ``csv.field_size_limit()``.

For example::

    module:
        table1.column1:
            table2.column2: |
                import csv
                csv.field_size_limit(262144)
                return source_row['column1']


Overall migration process
=========================

Migrating need several steps described below. If you need, you can easily write
a small script to automate this full process.

Before migration
----------------

The different steps before migration are the following. All of them are
important for the migration to be successful and should be done on the target db:

- Create a clean target database without demo data, using the latest migrated code
- Install the expected modules
- Rename the target company so that its name exactly match the company in the source database
- Remove the company of all internal sequences by running the following SQL:
  ``update ir_sequence set company_id=NULL;``. This will allow to remove duplicate after migration.

Migration
---------

The migration consists in running the ``migrate`` script by selecting the
correct options. If the data in the target database are not the one you expect,
you must adapt the options and the mapping file to obtain what you want.

Here is a real example ::

    ../bin/migrate -s sourcedb -t targetdb -p openerp6.1-openerp7.0.yml custom.yml
    -r res_partner account_move res_users pos_order pos_order_line account_move_line
    account_journal sale_order_line stock_inventory_line account_tax
    product_supplierinfo wkf_instance wkf_workitem wkf_triggers -w

After migration
---------------

The ``migrate`` script alone may not be sufficient for your database to be
clean and usable.  You may have to handle additional corrections. Please test
your instance thoroughly!  Since version 0.6 you shouldn't have to manually fix
the internal sequences, as they are now handled by the mapping file. You may
just clean them up to remove duplicates (from the menu
Settings/Technical/Sequences&Identifiers/Sequences).  However one of the
required remaining fixes consists in dropping some ``parent_left`` and
``parent_right`` columns. Here is the example with the accounting module::

    psql targetdb -c 'alter table account_account drop parent_left;'
    psql targetdb -c 'alter table account_account drop parent_right;'

You might also need to force a recalculation of new or changed related fields
that are persisted in the database (store=True).  Here is an example with 
the account_report_company module::

    psql targetdb -c 'alter table account_invoice drop commercial_partner_id;'

At the end, you should run a final global update of the database.
If you're using the `buildout recipe <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.recipe.openerp>`_ it should look like this::

    ../bin/start_openerp -u all -d targetdb --stop-after-init


Understanding errors
====================

The most difficult part of using this tool is to understand the errors during
the processing, as it requires a deep knowledge of how it internally works.
Most errors generally come from an erroneous mapping file. Errors can happen
during the processing of the CSV files, but the most difficult ones come from
the last import step, because some tables may fail to be imported. In this
case, you should carefully look at the logging messages at the end, and try to
understand the constraint errors or why tables cannot be imported. You also
should use the ``--keepcsv`` option, and inspect the intermediate CSV files to
understand the problem. By using this option, you will end up with a directory
containing five CSV files for each table.

For instance, for the ``res_partner`` table you will find these files:

 - **res_partner.csv** is the original data exported from the source
   database
 - **res_partner.target.csv** contains data after the first processing with
   the mapping file, but wrong foreign keys
 - **res_partner.target2.csv** contains final data with fixed foreign keys,
   that will eventually be imported at the end
 - **res_partner.update.csv** contains data which have been detected as
   existing in the target database, with wrong foreign keys.
 - **res_partner.update2.csv** contains the final existing data with fixed
   foreign keys, that will be used to update the target table after import.

If you're going into trouble during the import step with foreign key errors,
please have a look at this log, as it contains most of the common
encountered issues to solve:
